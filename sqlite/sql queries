-- Develop SQL queries to answer the following questions:
-- What are the peak hours for taxi usage?
-- How does passenger count affect the trip fare?
-- What are the trends in usage over the year?


-- Query to find peak hours for taxi usage
SELECT
    strftime('%H', tpep_pickup_datetime) AS hour_of_day,
    COUNT(*) AS num_trips
FROM processed_data
GROUP BY hour_of_day
ORDER BY num_trips DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Query to analyze how passenger count affects trip fare
SELECT
     passenger_count,
    avg(fare_amount) AS avg_fare
FROM processed_data
GROUP BY passenger_count
ORDER BY passenger_count;


-- Query to analyze trends in taxi usage over the year
SELECT
    strftime('%Y-%m', tpep_pickup_datetime) AS year_month,
    COUNT(*) AS num_trips
FROM processed_data
GROUP BY year_month
ORDER BY year_month;
